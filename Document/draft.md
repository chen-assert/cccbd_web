## 3.1 How to achieve the goals together(杜)

As for the teamwork, we intend to have a high-efficient teamwork. To achieve this, we have three aspects of how to reach the goals together.

- Clear Responsibility

  A team is made up of individuals. Individuals in a team often have different experiences, personalities and programming levels. Before the official start, we firstly carry out a reasonable division of labor which combine each person's characteristics and hobbies, give full play to the strengths of each team member. If the work is not pleasant and smooth, the efficiency will be low. After the division of labor is completed, each team member's corresponding responsibilities are determined.

- Efficient Communication

  After the completion of the division of work, the team will start to work, it must ensure the smooth flow of information within the whole team, especially among the team members whose work are related to each other. When problems are found, they need to be discussed in time to avoid unnecessary time waste. However, software development itself is a kind of work that needs to be focused and quiet, and many temporary interruptions will lead to the stagnation of development ideas, so our team have discussions at a fixed time every week. And fixed time will also let everyone form a habit, so that the efficiency can be improved.

  At each meeting, we always discuss these aspects as flowing:

  - Conclude from last week’s work or presentation, and find ways to overcome.

  - Set goals of this week, including the integral goal and each team members’s goal for this week.

  - Solve some difficult problems those cannot be solved by one team member.

  - Write the meeting agenda.

- Appropriate Tools

  Tools are very important of an efficient teamwork.

  The approach that most teams are taking right now is to introduce collaborative software that works for the whole team. With clear responsibilities and efficient communications, if team members are supported and coordinated by appropriate team collaboration tools, this project will be carried out more smoothly.

  So we use GitHub to develop the project as it can provide each members to contribute for their own part on their own computer and it is easy to solve the conflicts by merging the code. 

  Also we use MarkDown to write our documents, because it can be modified by more than one team member at the same time, and after everyone done their part just merge it on GitHub, it is very convenient for a team to write documents. As our project is a software project, we need to write some code in the document, and MarkDown makes it is extremely easy and straight to inset the code into the document.

The team is an integrity , not a set of individuals, we should always remember that the ultimate effectiveness of the team depends on the lowest efficiency of the team. Reasonable division of labor is the prerequisite to prevent the occurrence of problems, and establishing of efficient communication mechanism is an effective way to find problems.
